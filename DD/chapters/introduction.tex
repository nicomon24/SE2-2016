\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to give a more detailed and technical overview about PowerEnJoy system. \\
This document is addressed to developers and aims to identify:
\begin{itemize}
\item The high level architecture;\item The design patterns;\item The main components and their interfaces provided one for another;
\item The Runtime behavior.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope}
This document will present different level views in order to describe clearly the architecture of PowerEnJoy System. In particular we will present the component view, both high and low level, the deployment view, the runtime view and a further description of user interface, analysed in its runtime flow.\\
The System is based on two mobile applications and a web application. \\
As already explained in the RASD, the targets for the Service are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The Drivers;
\item The Workers;
\item The Admins.
\end{itemize}
The System allows the Drivers to reserve cars from both the mobile application and the web portal. At the same time it manages the the status of the cars and, if necessary, assigns tasks to the Workers via an ad-hoc mobile application. The Admins of the System can interact with the web portal to make privileged actions.
