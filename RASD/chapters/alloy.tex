In this chapter we will present the Alloy code and generated graphs used to check model consistency. The specification mostly relies on facts. 
\section{Alloy code}
\begin{lstlisting} [ language=Alloy ]
sig Vehicle {}

sig Email {}

sig License {}

sig PaymentInfo{}

sig Driver {
	email : Email
}

sig ValidDriver extends Driver {
	license : one License,
	paymentinfo : one PaymentInfo
}

sig Reservation {
	driver : one ValidDriver,
	vehicle : one Vehicle
}

fact uniqueDriverInfos {

	all d1,d2: Driver | 
	d1 != d2 => d1.email != d2.email
	
	all d1,d2: ValidDriver | 
	d1 != d2 => d1.license != d2.license
	
	all d1,d2: ValidDriver | 
	d1 != d2 => d1.paymentinfo != d2.paymentinfo
	
	ValidDriver.license = License
	
	ValidDriver.paymentinfo = PaymentInfo
	
	ValidDriver.email = Email
}

fact singleReservation {

	all r1, r2: Reservation | 
	r1 != r2 => r1.driver != r2.driver
	
	all r1, r2: Reservation | 
	r1 != r2 => r1.vehicle != r2.vehicle
}

fact mainteinance {
	
	all r : Reservation | 
	not (r.vehicle in Report.vehicle)
	
	all t1, t2 : Report | 
	t1 != t2 => t1.vehicle != t2.vehicle
}

//Workers signals
sig Worker {
}

sig Report {
	vehicle : one Vehicle,
	driver : one ValidDriver
}

sig Task extends Report{
	worker : Worker
}


pred show() {
	#Vehicle = 5
	#ValidDriver = 3
	#Reservation = 2
	#Report = 3
	#Worker = 2
}

run show for 5
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Generated world and results}
The simulation returned a consistent system. The generated graph is presented below: in this world there are total of 5 vehicles, 3 Drivers (all valid), 2 Workers. At the current time of the system, there are 2 active reservations, 2 active tasks in progress, and 1 generated report that is waiting for an available Worker to be assigned to.
