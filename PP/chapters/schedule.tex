We propose here a likely schedule for the project, shown in 2 GANTT charts. The chart are divided in a temporal basis to enhance readability. The first chart includes the Requirements Analysis and Design phases, whereas the second one includes the Development and Deployment phases. The total schedule duration is almost 7 months, that is very near the project effort estimation from the previous chapter.

The colors in the chart have the following meaning: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GREEN: } Macro-phase duration
\item \textbf{BLUE: } Meeting with PowerEni
\item \textbf{ORANGE: } Single task
\item \textbf{GRAY: } System is online
\end{itemize}
