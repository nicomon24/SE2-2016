In this chapter we will instead present similar GANTT charts, but instead of displaying the time-schedule only, we will combine it with a resource allocation schedule, i.e. what member of the team is executing the task. The tasks in this schedule and the division in 2 periods are the same of Chapter 3. 
\bigbreak
The colors in the chart have the following meaning: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GRAY: } Macro-phase duration 
\item \textbf{BLUE: } Meeting with PowerEni
\item \textbf{GREEN: } Nico Montali (aka nicomon) is executing the task 
\item \textbf{RED: } Enrico Fini (aka donkeyshot21) is executing the task
\item \textbf{ORANGE: } Task is executed by both team members, possibly dividing it into sub-tasks.
\end{itemize}
