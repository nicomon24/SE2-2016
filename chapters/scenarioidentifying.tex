\textbf{\large Scenario 1}
\bigbreak
It's about 9 in the morning and Ned, a well-known consultant, is leaving home to go to an important meeting. When he gets in his car and tries to start the engine the car refuses to turn on. Ned is very concerned because the meeting starts at 10 o'clock. Then he remembers of an advertising seen the day before, so he takes out his phone and looks for PowerEni, a new, reliable car sharing service, on the App Store. He is in a hurry but he discovers that the registration mechanism is fast and intuitive. Only one minute later he is ready to make a reservation using the map of near-by available cars on the application. He is really lucky, the nearest car is only 100m away from his position. Thanks to this new service Ned managed to arrive on time to the meeting.
