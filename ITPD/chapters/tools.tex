Since we are using Node.JS as our main programming language, we will use tools for Unit Testing and Integration Testing specific for it.
These tools are open-source (the github link is provided below)
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mocha} Test Engine, i.e. run tests at different level. \href{https://github.com/mochajs/mocha}{GitHub}
\item \textbf{Chai} Logic, i.e. to provide assertions \href{https://github.com/chaijs/chai}{GitHub}
\item \textbf{Sinon} Stubs and Drivers \href{https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon}{GitHub}
\end{itemize}

For the high-level integration with clients, instead, we will list devices that will be used to perform tests:
\item \textbf{Android clients} Various Android devices, preferably by Google (Nexux), each major version from 4.0 to the latest 7.1 beta. Test also different screen sizes.
\item \textbf{iOS clients} Various iOS devices, from iOS 8.0 to 10.2.1 beta.
\item \textbf{Browser} Various browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox) with different screen sizes.
