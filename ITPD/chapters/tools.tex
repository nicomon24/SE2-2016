Since we are using Node.JS as our main programming language, we will use tools for Unit Testing and Integration Testing specific for it.
These tools are open-source (the github link is provided below)
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mocha} Test Engine, i.e. run tests at different level. \href{https://github.com/mochajs/mocha}{GitHub}
\item \textbf{Chai} Logic, i.e. to provide assertions \href{https://github.com/chaijs/chai}{GitHub}
\item \textbf{Sinon} Stubs and Drivers \href{https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon}{GitHub}
