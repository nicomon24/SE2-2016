Since we used the Bottom-Up approach, we don't any implementation of stubs. Instead, we need Drivers to perform all the tests described in Chapter 3. For every integration step a driver is required, the test data set is straight-forward from the specification of chapter 3 again. 
To test the Router functionalities, an HTTP-client "driver" must be used, since the router also parses HTTP requests.
