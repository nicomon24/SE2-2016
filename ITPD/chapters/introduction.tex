\section{Purpose and Scope}
This document describes the plans for testing the integration of the components of the PowerEnjoy system. The purpose of this document is describe in a detailed way how to test the interfaces described in the Design Document [DD, Interfaces, Paragraph 2.7]. The integration tests will follow the sequence provided in this document, described later in Integration Strategy (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 will instead give a more detailed insight of the single tests to be run.
\newline
In this document we only take into account the integration testing of the components, i.e. test if the connections between components are functional, while Unit Testing, i.e. testing a single component in a stand-alone manner, is not described here and is assumed as already done when the component is considered ready for integration testing.
