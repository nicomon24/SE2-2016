As already mentioned before, the inspected class is a configuration class. Indeed the logic behind it is trivial and we found almost no algorithmic issue in it. \\
Conversely from the point of view of code style we found some formal error. These issues range from the lack of effectiveness of comments and outputs to some alignment error (e.g.: exceeding char limits).
Probably, the most serious issue we discovered is that the switch statements in some cases lack of break, return or default. \\
Totally, we found 10 issues, listed here (and available at the corresponding checklist entry).
