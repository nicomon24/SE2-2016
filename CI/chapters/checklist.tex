In this Chapter, every step of the Code Inspection checklist is documented. 

\section{Naming Conventions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [1] Variables names are meaningful 
\item [2] One-char variables are used only as exceptions. 
\item [3] Class names are mixed case with first uppercase letter.
\item [4] No interface is declared here
\item [5] All method names start with verbs and have mixed case
\item [6] All class variable have mixed with starting lower case char (no underscores either)
\item [7] This class has no constants
\end{enumerate}

\section{Indention}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [8] Four space are used to indent every time
\item [9] No tab are used in the file
\end{enumerate}

\section{Braces}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [10] All braces are in K\&R style.
\item [11] Every single statement block is braced correctly
\end{enumerate}

\section{File Organization}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [12] Section are well separated by spaces
\item [13] \textcolor{red}{Many lines exceed the 80 char limit even if not necessary.} Lines: 74, 86, 114, 116, 121, 198, 201, 228, 249, 268, 270, 278, 280 can be written more elegantly. Other lines exceed 80 char limit but can be accepted. 
\item [14] \textcolor{red}{Some lines also exceed 120 char limit.} Lines: 74, 228, 268, 270, 280
\end{enumerate}

\section{Wrapping lines}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [15] \textcolor{red}{Some operators are inserted after the line break.} Lines: 163, 164, 165, 166
\item [16] High-level breaks are used.
\item [17] \textcolor{red}{New statements are not aligned with the beginning of the previous line at the same level} Lines: 162, 163, 164, 165, 166
\end{enumerate}

\section{Comments}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [18] \textcolor{yellow}{Comments could explain more.} Some method's function could be better explained even if quite simple. 
\item [19] There is no commented out code.
\end{enumerate}

\section {Java Source Files} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item [20] This java contains only one Java Class.
\item [21] The public class is the first class of the file
\item [22] As in the Javadoc, this Class does not expose any external interface, only public variables to be read-only.
\item [23] The Javadoc is practically complete.
\end{enumerate}

\section {Package and Import Statements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [24] The first non comment line is the package, all the imports follows. 
\end{enumerate}

\section {Class and Interface Declarations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [25] Declarations follow the order provided. 
\item [26] Since methods perform very different tasks, it is difficult to find a correct order.
\item [27] Code is free of duplicates, long methods and big classes.
\end{enumerate}

\section {Initialization and Declarations}
\begin{enumerate}
\item [28] 
\end{enumerate}

\section {Arrays}
