The class we were assigned to inspect is:

\bigbreak
\textit{../org/apache/ofbiz/base/start/Config.java}
\bigbreak

Using the \href{https://ci.apache.org/projects/ofbiz/site/javadocs/}{Javadoc} (click on the link to open the URL) we found out that the class main objective was to
\bigbreak
\textit{set OFBiz server parameters needed on system startup and retrieved from one of the properties files in the start component}
\bigbreak

So it is a simple configuration class, where many parameters are loaded from files (.properties that can be found in the directory) and can be accessed through public and final instance variables.
